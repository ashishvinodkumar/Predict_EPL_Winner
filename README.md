# Goal
The goal of this project is to predict who is going to win the 2015-2016 english premier league season, along with identifying key features that influence a team’s ability to win the league. The report details building a hierarchical linear regression model, to account for all necessary predictors and any potential interactions that would improve the prediction ability of the model. The main takeaway from this report will be to assess the key features, and prediction accuracy of the model.

# Background 
English Premier League is the top soccer league in England which is contested by 20 teams each season. Each of these 20 teams play the other teams twice, once at their home stadium and once at their opponent’s home stadium (usually referred to as ‘away’). A win in a match between 2 teams results in 3 points, a draw results in 1 point, and a loss results in 0 points. As teams play each of the other teams in a round robin fashion, an official points table gets updated after each game to keep track of who is currently leading the points tally. At the end of the season, the team with the most points, is crowned champions of the english premier league for that given season. In this race to first place in the premier league, a team’s attributes such as defensive style, whether they press high up the pitch or sit deep in their own half, passing style, whether they make long diagonal passes or short and quick passes, and chance creation, whether a team is creating enough chances to score goals in the final third of the pitch, and many more such predictors determine the quality of the team throughout the entire season. I aim to incorporate all of these predictors to answer the following questions:

●	What are the key features that influence a team’s ability to win an english premier league season?

●	Assess the hierarchical linear regression model’s prediction accuracy both in-sample and out-of-sample. 

For the out-of-sample prediction, the report details predicting the winner of the 2015-2016 EPL season and comparing the result against the expected/actual winner.
